  <h3>About Marlene</h3> <!--Write about 3 sentences about myself-->
  <p>After graduating from UCR with a degree in Sustainability Studies, I worked for a solar comapany. Although, I am
    passionate about sustainability I was still seeking for alternative careers. Software Development became one of my
    interests, and I am more than eager to pursue Software Development.</p>

  <p>As a student at Thinkful, I've never felt more confident pursuing a career than I am now learning software development! If you're looking for a new well driven and good energy developer to hire, you're at the right place! I'm ready to effortlessly translate my passion with other developers!
